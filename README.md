Welcome to [Studay!](https://studay-alpha.vercel.app/)

This is a website where you can create a list of homework, using it to manage, view and filter information and get ready for the student's routine.

In the homework information, you can find its title, description, deadline, priority, and also add some useful links for your work!

Is it a **study day**? Nah, it is **Studay!**
